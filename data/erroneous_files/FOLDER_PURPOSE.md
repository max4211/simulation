# Erroneous Files

This folder is here to give multiple examples of the considerations we've 
made towards creating a robost simulation. Some of these files will cause 
a line to be printed in the command line and will force the user to reload
with a new file. Other files will work fine by replacing invalid or missing
data with defaults. They are all included in the hopes of showing the range 
of flaexibility we've built into this simulation.
